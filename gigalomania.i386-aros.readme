Gigalomania is an Open Source 2D Real Time Strategy (RTS)
Mega-Lo-Mania-like god game. Research and develop new technology with which
to conquer your enemies, from rocks and sticks to nuclear weapons and
spaceships. Advance through ten different ages, from the stone age to the
future. There are 28 different maps to play through. Also available for
Windows, Linux, OS X, AmigaOS 4, MorphOS, Android, Nokia Symbian, Maemo,
and Meego.

This has been tested using Icaros 2.0.3. Note that Gigalomania requires a
large stack - it seems to work okay with the AROS Shell default of 1024000
bytes.
